## What does Code and Effect do?

We write custom software. Customers come to us when they can’t find an off-the-shelf solution for a business problem. We work with them to find their pain points and develop software that solves that pain.

Rather than specializing in particular industries, we serve any small or medium-sized business that has unique processes requiring unique software. Some examples include custom e-commerce, mobile development, association management software, and customer management systems.

For specifics on our range of services, [start here](https://codeandeffect.com/consulting/).

## Why do you do that kind of work?

It brings us joy to help people work through their business problems in a structured and process-oriented way—and we’re good at it. We have the technical and strategic expertise to find creative and practical solutions that make a noticeable difference. Applying that expertise really is our idea of fun. :)

## What is your track record?

We have been at this since 2007. For the first 10 years of our company’s existence, we were known as AgileStyle, and we earned a reputation for doing professional, reliable work. We rebranded to Code and Effect in 2017. Our clients tell us we provide stress-free service, and they feel taken care of.

A [number of organizations](https://codeandeffect.com/speaking/) have invited us to share our insights over the years, and we take that as an indication that others see value in what we’ve learned.

We check in with our customers all of the time and have earned an average [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) of 9.5 out of 10 since 2015. On average, our customers have been with us for 5.5 years. They trust us not to up-sell them; they know we will recommend the best solution, not necessarily the most expensive one.

## What is important to you?

We seek to work with people who share our values, which drive everything we do:

### Relationships First

All our success is traceable to the relationships we've started and cultivated. Reputation, trust, reliability: it doesn't matter what label we use to measure them. They always come first.

### Give a Damn

You either do or you don’t, and we surround ourselves with people that do. It means doing what we say we will, going that extra mile, or pushing back hard when that extra mile is a mistake.

### Do the Right Amount

It's easy to over-engineer or not consider the impact on the future. We always strive to do just the right amount of thinking and execution. Then we reflect on the result and do it again.

## What are your goals?

We will build long-term relationships with people we can help. We will stay on top of changes in technology without leaving existing customers behind. And we will continue to hone our process so everyone can rest assured we have come up with the wisest solution.
