## Senior Ruby on Rails Developer

We’re looking for a Senior Ruby on Rails Developer with the following skills:

* Proven work experience as a Ruby on Rails developer
* Experience with Git and pull requests (Github, BitBucket, Gitlab)
* Experience writing unit and integration tests (minitest, RSpec)
* Experience working with production applications on Heroku
* Proficient in JavaScript and/or CoffeeScript
* A firm grasp of object-oriented analysis and design
* Passion for writing simple, clean, and efficient code
* Proficient using a Mac development environment
* Strong written and verbal communications skills
* Thrives in small teams

## The Company

Code and Effect has been building custom software for over 12 years.

* Customers come to us when they can’t find an off-the-shelf solution for a business problem. We work with them to find their pain points and develop software that solves that pain.
* It brings us joy to help people work through their business problems in a structured and process-oriented way, and we’re good at it. We have the technical and strategic expertise to find creative and practical solutions that make a noticeable difference. Applying that expertise really is our idea of fun.
* We're different from other shops because of our repeatable process, our structured communication, and the values we live and work by: [Relationships First, Give a Damn, and Do the Right Amount](https://codeandeffect.com/).

## The Location

Code and Effect is based in Edmonton, Alberta in the trendy Whyte Ave/Garneau area. This is a great place to work because:

* All the hipster coffee shops you could ask for in a 2 block radius (Transcend, Leva, Remedy)
* Easy access to public transit
* Great local lunch options (and the office always smells like cookies since we are above the UpperCrust Cafe)

## Why Should You Apply?

* Flexible work hours
* On-the-job training from industry experts
* Opportunity to work on a variety of interesting projects
* A fun, results-oriented team and all the coffee you can drink
