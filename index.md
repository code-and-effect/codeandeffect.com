values:
  - value_title: Relationships First

      "All our success is traceable to the relationships we've started and cultivated. Reputation, trust, reliability: it doesn't matter what label we use to measure them. They always come first."
  - value_title: Give a Damn
    value_description:

  - value_title: Do the Right Amount
    value_description:
      It's easy to over-engineer or not consider the impact on the future. We always strive to do _just the right_ amount of thinking and execution. Then we reflect on the result and do it again.
