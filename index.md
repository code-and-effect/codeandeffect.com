# **We use Ruby on Rails to design and develop web and mobile apps.**

## Our Services

### [**Web App Development**](https://codeandeffect.com/web-app-development)

We do an in-depth review of your existing processes, clarify your pain points, and build you a web app that drives results.

### [**Ecommerce Development**](https://codeandeffect.com/ecommerce-development)

When existing ecommerce platforms are not quite good enough, we map out your unique purchasing and checkout processes. Then we build a flexible, easy-to-use system that both you and your customers will love.

### [**Mobile App Development**](https://codeandeffect.com/mobile-app-development)

Android or iOS? Web app or native mobile app? Let us help you figure out the best way to achieve your goals and get started!

### [**Business Coaching**](https://codeandeffect.com/coach-and-grow)

We have run hundreds of software projects and have experienced many of the ups and downs of running a business. We will help you manage a software project, build a technical team, improve your operations, or grow as a leader.

> “We’re different from other shops because of our repeatable process, our structured communication, and the values we live and work by.

— Ashley Janssen, CEO at Code and Effect

## Our Core Values

**Relationships First**
All our success is traceable to the relationships we've started and cultivated. Reputation, trust, reliability: it doesn't matter what label we use to measure them. They always come first.

**Give a Damn**
You either do or you don’t, and we surround ourselves with people that do. It means doing what we say we will, going that extra mile, or pushing back hard when that extra mile is a mistake.

**Do the Right Amount**
It's easy to over-engineer or not consider the impact on the future. We always strive to do _just the right_ amount of thinking and execution. Then we reflect on the result and do it again.

## Example Projects We Work On

### **Business Software**

Instead of shoehorning your business into a tool that doesn’t quite do what you want, we work with you to build _exactly what you need_.

This often means we help transition away from paper-based systems, messy excel spreadsheets, and legacy software. Or, together we will build your vision from the ground up!

### **Custom Ecommerce**

There are complex purchasing and checkout processes with many steps that other ecommerce platforms are not able to support. That’s where we come in!

We map out your ecommerce processes to ensure your customers enjoy a user-friendly experience while giving you a flexible and easy-to-use backend to keep your products up-to-date.

### **Member Portals**

Professional and regulatory associations each have unique bylaws, accreditation, application management, and professional development. We’ve seen them all.

The member portals that we build help your membership maintain good standing, simplifies your processes, and provide tools to effectively manage your membership.

## Example Organizations We Work With

**A small business** that needs to replace their spreadsheets with actionable forms, reports, and tools.

**A non-profit** that needs to provide support and training to thousands of people with limited resources.

**A brick and mortar business** that needs to expand into e-commerce to continue growing.

**A professional association** that needs to serve their members more effectively.

**An entrepreneur** that needs structure and tools for driving their own accountability.

**An organization** that needs software to assist hundreds of their clients to make decisions.
