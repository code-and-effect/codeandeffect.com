subtext: "Support and Improve is our ongoing support, maintenance, and improvement of your association management software once it has been launched. Software is never really “done”. As you use the new software within your organization and with your members, new ideas for improvements, new use cases, and new processes will come up. Software also needs to be maintained with the latest updates so that it stays snappy and runs smoothly. "

## How does Support and Improve work?

It’s easy! You make a request, we give you a cost and timeline for completion. How formal this process is is up to you! Some of our customers like to have a statement of work with a purchase order for all requests, others like to send an email. We tailor how we manage this to your organization and your preferences.

## What types of things do you do as part of Support and Improve?

* New feature development
* Current feature improvement
* Bug fixes (all software, no matter how awesome, will have the occasional bug!)
* Updates and security patches
* Weekly, monthly or quarterly check-in meetings, depending on need

## How much does Support and Improve cost?

How much you invest in new features, feature improvements, and ongoing updates, is entirely up to you. That said, we suggest a minimum budget of $500 to $1000 a month to keep your software in tip-top shape.

We recommend you keep 20% of your total project budget for this phase.

## Why is Support and Improve important?

Support and Improve will:

* Extend the lifetime and return on your initial investment
* Ensure the latest security and performance patches are applied proactively so your software runs smoothly

## How is Support and Improve billed?

You will be billed on the first of each month for the work done in the previous month. This will always be an expected cost based on your approval.
