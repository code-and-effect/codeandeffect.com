## What is Coach and Grow?

Coach and Grow is a structured consulting and coaching engagement that provides the tactics, tools, and accountability to overcome your challenges.

## Why would I hire you to Coach and Grow my business?

We are skilled at bringing structure to chaos, and business can be chaotic. Sometimes it is helpful to have an external, unbiased view of the challenges you are facing and someone to be accountable to reach your goals. These are are the types of challenges that our customers often ask us to help with:

* Building a technical team.
* Pulling themselves out of the day-to-day of their businesses to focus on strategic planning.
* Organizational and process development.
* Business problems that they are not sure how to approach.

## Who is Coach and Grow for?

* Entrepreneurs
* Small business operators
* Integrators
* Freelancers

## How does it work?

* We decide on a specific time, usually one hour a week or bi-weekly, to meet.
* We provide you with an agenda template that you fill out and provide to us before each meeting.
* In this agenda you report on your progress from the last meeting, identify the challenge(s) you want to address at this meeting, and the outcomes you want to achieve.
* We use our expertise and tools to work through the challenge and then set goals/accountabilities for you to achieve prior to the next meeting.
* Repeat!

## What kind of results can I expect from Coach and Grow?

Regardless of the challenge, we are helping you overcome, you can expect the following:

* **Structure** - We schedule regular meetings, with agendas, to identify goals and the actions that need to be taken to achieve them.
* **Accountability** - Once we know what needs to be done, we help make sure that everyone involved is accountable to what they committed to.
* **Results** - We regularly monitor and measure progress to make sure the actions that are being taken are moving you closer to achieving your goals.
