## How does Develop and Launch work?

Develop and launch is based on the prototype, feature sheet, estimate and schedule we built together during Discover and Plan.

1. <strong>Set a weekly or bi-weekly meeting.</strong> At the same time every week, we meet or have a phone call for 20 to 40 minutes to provide an update on the status of the project, ask questions, and make decisions as the project progresses.
2. <mark>Progress demos.</mark> When the web application has progressed far enough we will review each feature together. These reviews happen with video conferencing / screen sharing as part of our regular weekly meetings. A secure staging server is available for you to review progress and you may access it at any point during development.
3. <mark>Pre-launch.</mark> Before launch, an exhaustive automated and manual testing phase occurs. Edge cases or confusing processes are ironed out! We ensure your organization has the training they need to use the software and coordinate a launch date.
4. <mark>Launch!</mark> When everything is ready to go, we go live! You should expect everything to go smoothly.

## How does Develop and Launch work?

Develop and launch is based on the prototype, feature sheet, estimate and schedule we built together during Discover and Plan.

### 1. Set a weekly or bi-weekly meeting

At the same time every week, we meet or have a phone call for 20 to 40 minutes to provide an update on the status of the project, ask questions, and make decisions as the project progresses.

### 2. Progress demos

When the web application has progressed far enough we will review each feature together. These reviews happen with video conferencing / screen sharing as part of our regular weekly meetings. A secure staging server is available for you to review progress and you may access it at any point during development.

### 3. Pre-launch testing

Before launch, an exhaustive automated and manual testing phase occurs. Edge cases or confusing processes are ironed out! We ensure your organization has the training they need to use the software and coordinate a launch date.

### 4. Launch!

When everything is ready to go, we go live! You should expect everything to go smoothly.



## Can I change features during development?

Yes! Because we know that all projects will have something unexpected come up during development, we plan for it. When this happens, there are two options:

1. Keep your budget the same, remove a less important but similarly priced feature, and add the new feature.
2. Increase your budget and add the new feature.

We give you the tools and information to weigh the choices and make a confident decision.

##  Why do we need to meet every week?

Our experience is that a weekly rhythm is just the right amount of project meetings. Our goals are communication, accountability, and focus:

Communication: every meeting you will know what has been done since our last meeting, what will be done before our next meeting, and what’s preventing us from getting something specific done. We’ll provide an update on schedule and solve any new issues that have cropped up. You will have no uncertainty about project status!


Accountability: shared action items help us stay accountable to one another. If we promise to do something, we write it down as an action item which will appear on the next week’s agenda. Of course, the same goes for anything you promise!


Focus: regular meetings let us schedule discussions and decisions that might otherwise interrupt day-to-day work, helping all stakeholders focus. Do you really want your inbox full of one-off project questions and dozens of email threads every week? We don’t either, and “let’s add that to our next check-in agenda” is a powerful phrase for focus.
