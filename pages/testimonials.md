        &ldquo;Our organization chose to work with Code and Effect to develop a new registration database. The process has been on budget and within very reasonable time frames. Dana and Matt fully understand the regulatory environment and can not only predict some common workflows and features that are needed, but can also provide valuable insight to improve how we complete common tasks. The bi-weekly check in’s and use of online tools to ensure each component is fully tested has been invaluable in providing assurance the final product will meet our organizational needs.&rdquo;
