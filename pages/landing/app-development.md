## Who is Code and Effect?

We are an Edmonton-based software consultancy that’s been around since 2007. We design, develop, and support custom web applications that run on your desktop browser and on your mobile devices.

## Why should I work with Code and Effect?

- We have a repeatable, proven process for scoping and managing software projects so they stay within budget and are launched on schedule.
- We’re not a faceless offshore development shop. Our offices are just off Whyte Ave!
- We operate by our core values: relationships first, give a damn, and do the right amount.

## What do you mean by “Web Application”?

We mean any website or portal with advanced functionality--from member-only areas to ecommerce, to reporting, to wizards that guide users through complex processes. This is custom software development where the software is designed to run in any browser!

## What type of web applications do you develop?

We develop software that solve real, existing business problems. Simple as that.

Software we develop together will replace paper-based forms, messy excel spreadsheets, and legacy desktop software. We bring along all of the data and workflow from these old systems but move them online to be accessed by staff and customers from anywhere. These business tools are often business-critical and have an obvious return on investment. You might be thinking of an example that applies to you right now--and yes, we build that.

## How much does web application development cost?

Well, _that depends ;)_ That’s like asking “how much does it cost to build a house?”. Hhow big is the house? How many bedrooms and bathrooms? What kind of appliances? And a hundred other questions.

It’s the same with web application development: What problem are you trying to solve? Who are your users? Do you need to integrate with other apps? And a hundred other questions.

But we have a recommended minimum budget of $50,000, split into two phases:

Discover and Plan is our process to answer all the unknowns. The standard Discover and Plan starts at $15,000. It’s our tried-and-true way to get the information we need to get a clear blueprint to develop your application and provide you with an accurate estimate.

Develop and Launch, where we build out the web application we planned together, starts at $35,000.

## How long does it take to develop a web application?

Similar to asking how much does web application development cost, how long it takes to develop an application depends on many factors. Discover and Plan usually runs for 6 to 8 weeks. Develop and Launch is a minimum of 12 weeks, and will depend on the size of the project. You can expect most application development projects to run for a minimum of 18 weeks.

## Are there ongoing costs after my web application is launched?

Yes, but not from us. We will set you up as the billing contact for your hosting and third-party integrations. The typical minimum cost for these services is $50/month. Code and Effect does not charge you a fixed retainer or monthly cost for support--you’ll only receive an invoice if you’ve requested and approved work.

We optionally offer a more complete support package via Support and Improve. Historically we see new projects invest an additional 20% of their original budget post-launch.

## What is your process?

We have a set process: start with Discover and Plan to understand your needs and scope the work, implement with Develop and Launch, and then provide long-term sustainability with Support and Improve.

## How do you communicate during a project?

We use structured meetings! All projects have a weekly or bi-weekly meeting scheduled for the duration of the project. Meetings always have an agenda filled with the project updates and questions sent ahead of time. These agendas are powered by Tadum, our meeting and agenda software. We’ll also add you to our project management software so that you have complete transparency.

## What type of customers do you work with?

We work with customers across a variety of industries and business types. Instead of a specific niche, we usually work with customers with one of these 3 problems:

- They have existing software that isn’t meeting their needs;
- They have looked into the available vendor solutions, often through Research and Recommend, but can’t find one that meets their needs; or,
- They have a new business idea that they need a partner to develop because they don’t have the expertise in-house.

## What technology do you develop your web applications in?

We develop all of our web applications using Ruby on Rails. It’s the best technology available for creating business-centric web applications, and we have many tools built out already that we can leverage for new projects.

## Do you integrate with other software?

Yes. We are able to integrate with most software, either via the documented API or by dumping your data so that it can be manually imported. Example integrations we can develop for you include email newsletters (e.g. MailChimp, Constant Contact), accounting software (e.g. QuickBooks), marketing software (e.g. Infusionsoft).

## Do you have experience with vouchers and grants?

Yes. We have worked with many customers who have accessed funding. Examples of funding sources we have worked on are through Alberta Innovates vouchers and the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Program.

## Can you import my old data?

Yes. We can import almost any data into your new web app, it doesn’t matter if that data is stuck in an old MS Access database, a spreadsheet, a WordPress website, or anywhere else.

## Can I export my new data?

Yes. You will have the tools to easily export data, so that it can be loaded into another application, like an Excel spreadsheet.

## Do you use offshore developers?

No. It’s been our experience that the challenges working with offshore developers makes it easy for a project to miss deadlines and go over budget. We prefer to work with our local network of trusted partners.

## Who owns the intellectual property?

You do! As part of every contract, we ensure as much of the intellectual property as possible is owned solely by our clients. We retain no license for your project and cannot reuse or resell it.

## When are you able to start?

We generally start new projects 1-4 months after acceptance of a proposal, depending on our existing obligations. But if the timeline is a concern, no problem, we can probably make it work--just ask!

## How do I get started?

Let’s have a conversation: we’ll talk about your needs and make sure we’re a good fit for one another. If we aren’t a good fit, we probably know someone in the Edmonton application developer community that we can introduce you to.
