**Problem:** Hard to use websites that don’t communicate well to your membership, not knowing what platform to go with.

**Solution:** Member websites on the right platform that are easy to navigate, update, and clearly communicate with your members.

## The right kind of site

We’ve helped design and launch public-facing websites for many associations. Each one has different, but similar, requirements from one another... and there are many options for how an association website can be implemented! We will work with you to weigh the pros and cons of each option and move forward with what’s best for your organization.

## Integrated where it matters

We recommend keeping your association website separate from your member database and member portal. Member portals should have a lifespan of more than 10 years and are much more complex than a public-facing website. By keeping the website and member portal separate you reduce your total cost and are able to more easily make changes in the future.
