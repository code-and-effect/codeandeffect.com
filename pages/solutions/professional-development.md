**Problem:** Tracking CE and PD can be cumbersome and time-consuming, but it's mandated.

**Solution:** A system that is easy for your membership to fill in, and easy for you to audit.

## Easy to maintain records

We’ve helped implement online continuing education and professional development trackers that have recorded hundreds of thousands of hours worth of activities. No matter what your annual statements and calculations look like, we’ve handled something like it before.

## Calculations, caps, and carry forwards

For members, tracking is necessary to maintain their credentials. We ensure they have easy to use online continuing education and professional development tracking that automatically calculates hours or credits, minimums, maximums, per category restrictions, and more. It’s never been easier to stay on top of it!

## Tools to audit

We know that for many associations, annual audits of a percentage of membership is mandated... but incredibly painful. If your members are using paper or Excel-based logbooks you need to contact them for submission, sift through receipts and other proof documents, and manually calculate that their hours or credits are correct. This is why we develop online systems that streamline submission, validation, auditing, revisions, and final processing.
