**Problem:** Problem: Complex application forms that have a lot of moving parts means lots of headaches for the Executive Director and office.

**Solution:** Custom forms that support these exact process so they are easy and move smoothly.


## We know applications

We’ve helped our clients collect, review, and process over 20,000 membership applications. And these aren’t simple “fill in a form and you’re in” applicants: we’re talking detailed submissions that include university transcripts, proof of published work, references, and many other little details.

## Coordinate your committees

We also build the tools that let registrars and registration committee members review the applicant submissions (entirely online, no printouts or dropbox folders!), make their recommendation, and ultimately process the applicant. We handle all the common “gotchas” in this process like requests for missing/unclear applicant information, calculating valid course credits, and approval for an alternative membership category.

## Direct applicants to the next step

Once an applicant is accepted the system automatically takes care of the steps like: prorated dues payment, complete mandatory training like an online ethics exam, purchase a stamp or ring, or download a membership card or certificate PDF.
