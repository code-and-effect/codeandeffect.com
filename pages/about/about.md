title: About
subtext: Code and Effect is a software consultancy that works with professional, regulatory, and member-based associations and colleges. We develop cloud-based software that matches your rules, bylaws, and regulatory requirements. Instead of an off-the-shelf Association Management System (AMS) that you fight and work around, we guide you through our discovery process, then build and support a system that meets your exact specifications.
