  Ruby on Rails has an amazing developer community and the gems created by these developers
  have helped us out many times. Now, it’s our turn to give back: we’ve built effective_gems

  helped us, and we think they can help you too.'

## About the effective_gems

[effective_gems](https://github.com/code-and-effect) offer solutions for common hurdles faced by Ruby on Rails developers. Each of the effective_gems is a Rails engine that is generally independent from the other effective_gems. This is not a suite of gems you have to use all together, but rather a growing library of gems you can pick and choose from. These gems are part of the secret sauce that allow us to quickly roll out functionality for our clients.

## [effective_addresses](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_addresses)

**_You need to collect and validate one or more addresses._** Extend any ActiveRecord object to have one or more named addresses, like @user.billing_address. Includes a geographic region-aware custom form input backed by Carmen.

## [effective_assets](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_assets)

**_You need to upload files directly to Amazon S3._** Upload images and files directly to AWS S3 with a custom form input then seamlessly organize and attach them to any ActiveRecord object.

## [effective_datatables](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_datatables)

**_You need to sort, search, export, and paginate tables of data._** Uniquely powerful server-side searching, sorting and filtering of any ActiveRecord or Array collection as well as post-rendered content displayed using [DataTable.js](https://datatables.net/).

## [effective_email_templates](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_email_templates)

**_You and/or your clients need to modify email content on-the-fly without re-deploying your rails app._** Create one or more email templates using the Liquid templating language. Update those templates from an admin screen to modify the content of your email sends without re-deploying your rails application.

## [effective_form_inputs](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_form_inputs)

**_You need to augment the existing Rails Form Helper and SimpleForm inputs with minimal additional configuration._** Contains a curated collection of custom form inputs, along with their Javascript & CSS assets, that may be installed individually or all at once. Customize any option used to initialize the javascript library by declaring those options in ruby.

## [effective_logging](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_logging)

**_You need to record activity of users, emails, and background jobs._** Automatically log all sent emails, user logins, and page views. Logs are tied to a parent and an associated object (e.g. User and Order). You can also cleanly log custom events from Ruby and JavaScript.

## [effective_obfuscation](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_obfuscation)

**_You need to mask primary keys in a param or view._** Display unique 10-digit numbers instead of ActiveRecord IDs. Hides the ID param so curious website visitors are unable to determine your user or order count.

## [effective_orders](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_pages)

**_You need to process orders, with or without a shopping cart._** Quickly build an online store with carts, orders, automatic email receipts, and payment collection via [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/), [StripeConnect](https://stripe.com/connect), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), or [Moneris](http://www.moneris.com/).

## [effective_pages](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_pages)

**_You need a fully-functional CMS that provides full or restricted editing for you and your end users._** Works with effective_regions to create WYSIWYG editable content pages based on one or more templates -- just regular Rails views -- that you define and control. Edit menus with a drag-and-drop bootstrap3-strict menu builder.

## [effective_posts](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_posts)

**_You need a basic blog with WYSIWYG content editing, post scheduling, pagination and optional top level routes for each post category._** Works with effective_regions to create WYSIWYG editable posts. Define one or more top level categories, such as 'news', 'blogs', 'events' and get appropriate top-level routes and URLs. Has built-in pagination and smart html-aware truncation of content to display post excerpts.

## [effective_regions](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_regions)

**_You need to write and publish content in an end-user friendly manner across multiple page templates._** Create editable content regions within your existing, ordinary ActionView::Base views, and update content with an actually-good full-screen WYSIWYG editor.

## [effective_roles](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_roles)

**_You need to assign roles and query objects with role-based permissions._** Assign multiple roles to any User or other ActiveRecord object. Select only the appropriate objects based on intelligent, chainable ActiveRecord::Relation finder methods.

## [effective_style_guide](https://github.com/code-and-effect/effective_style_guide)

**_You need to make sure your CSS looks great when applied to Bootstrap3._** Creates a /styleguide page that renders the correct HTML for all Bootstrap3 (v3.2.0) components. Ensure that your custom CSS theme looks good with all Twitter Bootstrap3 html components.
