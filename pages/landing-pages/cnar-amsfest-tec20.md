* [https://www.cnar-rcor.ca/post/cnar-2020-goes-digital](https://www.cnar-rcor.ca/post/cnar-2020-goes-digital)

<h3 class="h3-small">What's it about?</h3>

> CNAR 2020 will be the hub this fall to receive continuous Canadian-specific content. The interactive digital conference, which will be spread out and offered in 'bite-sized' sessions from September to November, will offer continuous connection and learning among Canadian regulators on such timely, hot-button issues as diversity, the COVID-19 impact on day-to-day regulatory practices, and more.

We are event sponsors! You can find us in the exhibition hall on November 18th, or you can drop off a "virtual card" at any other time, or you can find Ashley Janssen in the group chat during many of the speaking events.
